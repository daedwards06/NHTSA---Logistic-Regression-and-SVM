# NHTSA---Logistic-Regression-and-SVM

Perform predictive analysis (classification) upon a data set: model the dataset using
logistic regression and support vector machines, and making conclusions from the analysis. Follow the CRISP-DM framework in your analysis

# SVM and Logistic Regression Modeling

- Create a logistic regression model and a support vector machine model for the classification task involved with your dataset. 
- Assess how well each model performs using 80/20 training/testing split for the data
- Adjust parameters of the models to make them more accurate.
- Discuss the advantages of each model for each classification task
- Use the weights from logistic regression to interpret the importance of different features for the classification task
